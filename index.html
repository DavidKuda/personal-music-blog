                        It took me quite some time until I have got into Pink Floyd. And once I got into it, I have
                        found Pink Floyd to be incomparably deep and immersive. Many years before my discovry of Pink
                        Floyd,
                        a friend once has told me: "Pink Floyd is not just music, it is art." I think he could't be more
                        accurate.

                        This was Coldplay's first album. The sound to me is very thoughtful and beautiful. The guitar
                        work is very inspiring, consisting mostly of acoustic guitar chords, which are mostly modal,
                        enriched with dreamy tensions.

                        Hendrix has spent all his time jamming with his guitar. Everywhere he went, he
                        brought his
                        guitar along. He create a unique, distinct style which inspired probably any
                        guitar player
                        after him.

                         The results are truly amazing.
