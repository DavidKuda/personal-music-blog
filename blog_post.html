                        I had a night booked at The Blue Whale—a killer jazz club in Los Angeles—but hadn’t yet selected a band. While touring
                        with Snarky Puppy, I got talking with Mark and Sput about NAMM (a music convention held each January, south of Los
                        Angeles). They were both going to be in town for it so I asked them to join me at the Whale. Then I asked Kaveh (bassist
                        in Kneebody, among other bands). We'd performed together recently and I was looking for an excuse to play again. Then I
                        found out Nir (who I'd been playing with for awhile) was going to be in town from New York. Perfect! This was my chance
                        to experiment with a two-guitar band.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ever since playing in John Mayer’s band, I’d wanted to lead a guitar-based group. John had three guitarists (including
                        himself) in his touring band. This meant a lush cushion of guitar-y goodness enveloped every solo I played. Imagine the
                        best mattress and pillow combination you’ve ever experienced. It feels like that. But of course, it’s not just the
                        guitar. It’s the player.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Excited by the idea of this group, I decided to borrow a page from the Snarky Puppy playbook and film it. There was one
                        catch: we had no time to rehearse, and barely a sound check. I’d played with each of these guys in different scenarios,
                        but never as a unit. So we set up in a circle, surrounded by an audience and five cameras, and played these tunes
                        together for the first time. No pressure! I thought we might get two or three good videos out of it. We got more. Alex
                        Chaloff and his team captured not only gorgeous video but stunning audio. When I heard the result I realized this needed
                        to be its own album. So here it is. Live. Raw. Filled with an energy that comes only from tight-rope walking in front of
                        an audience. My younger self would hear only the “mistakes.” My current-age-self hears the magic. I hope you hear it,
                        too.
                    </p>
